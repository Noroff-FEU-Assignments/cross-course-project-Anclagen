css
considering size of css file, decided to have a general style sheet with all the reusable styles and navigation and footer styles, and then a css for each page to make fixing problems easier and avoid conflicts

products grid on home couldn't be reused on products as I wanted 1/2/3 not 1/2/4 because of filter.

reused two column grid across pages

product item setup reused on home, product and products pages
